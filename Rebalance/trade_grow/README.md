1. Starting Point
You begin with a $3,000 account.
2. Capital Split
The account is split into:
40% ($1,200): Actively traded (“trading capital”)
60% ($1,800): Held in reserve (“reserve capital”)
3. Trade Mechanics
Each trade uses the trading capital.
If you win a trade:
The trading capital increases by 10% (of its current value).
If you lose a trade:
The trading capital decreases by 50% (of its current value).
If you lose, you use the reserve to replenish the trading capital back to the original 40%/60% split (if possible).
4. Rebalancing
After each trade, check if the trading capital has grown to be more than the reserve.
If so, re-split the total account into 40% trading and 60% reserve again.
5. Recovery Mechanism
The reserve acts as a buffer:
If you lose, you can “top up” the trading capital from the reserve, so you need fewer consecutive wins to recover from a loss.
This system is designed to reduce the risk of ruin and make recovery from losses easier.

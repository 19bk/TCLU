Certainly! Let's set up your Flask application to run in a tmux session. This way, it can run alongside your other script without interfering. Here's how to do it:

1. If tmux is not installed, install it:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install tmux
   ```

2. Create a new tmux session for your Flask app:
   ```
   tmux new-session -d -s cryptotrends
   ```

3. Send commands to the tmux session to start your Flask app:
   ```
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'cd /root/cryptotrends' C-m
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'source venv/bin/activate' C-m
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'python app.py' C-m
   ```

4. Create a startup script to automate this process. Create a new file named `start_cryptotrends.sh` in your home directory:
   ```
   nano /root/start_cryptotrends.sh
   ```

5. Add the following content to this file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   tmux new-session -d -s cryptotrends
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'cd /root/cryptotrends' C-m
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'source venv/bin/activate' C-m
   tmux send-keys -t cryptotrends 'python app.py' C-m
   ```

6. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x /root/start_cryptotrends.sh
   ```

7. You can now start your Flask app in a tmux session by running:
   ```
   /root/start_cryptotrends.sh
   ```

8. To view the output or interact with your Flask app, you can attach to the tmux session:
   ```
   tmux attach -t cryptotrends
   ```
   To detach from the session without stopping it, press `Ctrl+B`, then `D`.

9. If you need to stop the app, you can kill the tmux session:
   ```
   tmux kill-session -t cryptotrends
   ```

10. To ensure your app starts automatically when the server reboots, add it to crontab:
    ```
    (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot /root/start_cryptotrends.sh") | crontab -
    ```

Now your Flask app will run in a tmux session, allowing it to coexist with your other script. You can manage both scripts independently in their respective tmux sessions.

To check on your running tmux sessions:
```
tmux list-sessions
```

Remember, you can always attach to a session to see its output, and detach when you're done checking on it.

This setup allows your Flask app to run continuously in the background, persist through SSH disconnections, and automatically restart on server reboots.
